## ✨ Overview

**Driver Drowsiness Detection System** is a real-time, AI-powered solution built in Python to prevent accidents caused by sleepy drivers. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, it monitors driver alertness and sends warnings when signs of drowsiness are detected.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Face & Eye Detection:** Uses OpenCV and pre-trained models to identify the driver's face and eyes in live video.
2. **Drowsiness Analysis:** Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect slow blinks or closed eyes.
3. **Real-Time Alerts:** Triggers buzzer sounds and on-screen warnings if drowsiness is detected.
4. **Safety First:** Designed for ease of use in vehicles, using only a webcam and your Python environment.

## 💡 How It Detects Drowsiness

- **EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio):**  
  Measures the ratio of distances between key eye landmarks. If EAR drops below a threshold for a set number of frames, the driver is likely drowsy.
